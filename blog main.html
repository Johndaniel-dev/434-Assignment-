        <h3>400 Level Reflections</h3>
        <p class="date">October 26, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Being in my 400 level, I’ve been here for quite a while. It’s been
          tiring and stressful, but at the same time, deeply impactful. Every
          challenge has come with a lesson, and every experience feels like a
          step closer to something worthwhile. Looking back, I’m grateful for
          how far I’ve come — and looking ahead, I’m hopeful that all the hard
          work will pay off.

          Managing time between lectures, projects, and friendships isn’t always
          easy, but it’s all part of the growth. Here’s how I stay organized and
          make the most out of every day on campus.
